> **What you'll learn**
> Find out if your business is able to to use an off the shelf solution (like the Xero integration app on Hubspot marketplace) or if you'll require something more bespoke.

> We'll run through an example with an Australian SME (so we take **currency conversion** and **GST (10%)** into account) but otherwise this guide is universally applicable for any 2025 integrations.

If you have any questions, feel free to ask in the contact box and I'll get back to you with an answer.

## The end goal of a HubSpot ↔ Xero Integration

The idea behind integrating Hubspot and Xero is to avoid re-entry (writing data to multiple platforms manually).
Manually entering data is not only time consuming but can lead to pretty serious accounting errors when data inevitably doesn't match up.

The **sales-to-cash** automation you actually want:

    1.	Deal/Quote in HubSpot → Xero invoice (draft/authorised) saved back to the Deal.
    2.	Xero status change → CRM write-back (Sent / Part-Paid / Paid / Overdue, payment dates/amounts).
    3.	Per-line Tracking Categories + correct GST (one inclusive/exclusive policy).
    4.	Contacts & Companies in sync to Xero Contacts (name/ABN/addresses), dedup by email/ABN.
    5.	Products ↔ Items mapped (SKU→ItemCode; AccountCode/TaxType applied on each line).
    6.	Progress/Deposit invoicing from stages (e.g., 30/50/20%) with Billed %/Outstanding updated in HubSpot.

## Why app-only integrations break (and what we fix)

### One-way vs bi-directional truth

Apps sync a subset of objects. You need **reliable write-backs** to Deals for revenue visibility.

### Contact-only associations

Invoices attach to **Contacts**, not **Companies/Deals**, so reports go blind.

### Limited field mapping

Addresses, **tax/SKU**, **Tracking Categories**, and status dates often don’t map cleanly.

### Duplicates/idempotency

Retries create duplicates without **idempotency** and state.

### Quotes not syncing cleanly

Quote → invoice can lose line-item fidelity (SKUs/tax/Tracking).

**What “good” looks like (teaser from the Readiness Checklist):**

- Deal shows live invoice state + payment date
- Zero duplicate invoices on retries
- Tracking Categories on **every** line
- Reconciliation log for failures (auditable)

## Architecture that works: HubSpot ↔ ODS ↔ Xero

- **Identity matching:** Contacts/Companies/Deals ↔ Xero Contacts/Invoices
- **Idempotency & state:** safe retries, no duplicates
- **Mappings:** **GST** rules, **SKUs**, **Tracking Categories (Region/Dept)**
- **Write-backs:** status + dates to Deal (and links back to Xero)

**Include:** diagrams, object names, example fields.
**Hold back (your IP):** association tables, webhook endpoints, retry windows, DB schema.

## Prerequisites (save yourself time)

- **HubSpot:** Super Admin/Marketplace perms; Deals/Quotes; Products/Line Items enabled.
- **Xero:** Role with **Tracking Categories**, **Tax rates**, Branding Themes, Chart of Accounts.
- **Security:** MFA/2FA on both.
- **Decisions upfront:** **GST inc/exc**, which entity holds **Tracking Categories**, invoice trigger (e.g., **Closed-Won**).

---

## Step-by-step (high level)

### 1) Discovery & data audit

Identify edge cases (multi-entity, currencies), legacy duplicates, tax handling, and the real triggers.

### 2) Define the data model

Name properties, associations, and write-back fields (Deal status/date, invoice link).

### 3) Map taxes & Tracking Categories

Decide where they live (**Deal vs line item**) and how they’re applied; document Xero Category/Options.

### 4) Design the flows

Deal/Quote triggers → Xero **draft/authorised** invoice; define exception paths.

### 5) Implement the ODS

State, **idempotency keys**, failure logs, reconciliation view.

### 6) Write-backs to HubSpot

Status (Sent/Part-Paid/Paid/Overdue), Payment Date, and helpful error messages.

### 7) Testing & sandbox runs

Sample Deals, **partial payments**, refunds/credits, multi-org routing.

### 8) Go-live & monitoring

Alerting, retries, weekly checks, change management.

## Property map starter (HubSpot → Xero)

| HubSpot Source | Xero Target       | Notes                          |
| -------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Company.Name   | Contact.Name      | Prefer Company as Xero Contact |
| Deal.Name      | Invoice.Reference | Traceability                   |
| Line Items     | Invoice.LineItems | Map SKU → ItemCode if used     |
| gst_handling   | TaxType           | Inclusive vs Exclusive         |
| tracking\_\*   | LineItem.Tracking | Region/Department on each line |

---

## Handling the tricky bits (edge cases you’ll meet)

**Multiple Xero orgs/brands:** route by Deal property (e.g., `xero_org`).
**Partial payments/credits/refunds:** decide write-back behavior and visibility.
**Invoice edits after sync:** define source-of-truth rules.
**Products/SKUs:** normalise in ODS vs HubSpot; prevent drift.
**Currency & tax mode:** keep **inc/exc** consistent end-to-end.
**Migrations:** clean duplicates before go-live.

> If two or more apply, DIY risk grows — we’ll design the guardrails.

---

## What good looks like (definition of done)

- Deal shows **live invoice state** and **payment date**
- No duplicate invoices on retries
- Tracking Categories present on **every line**
- Reconciliation view for failures & manual interventions
- **Auditability:** who changed what, when

---

## Mini case snapshot (anonymised)

- Zero re-entry from Deals to Invoices
- 4–6 weeks to go-live with monitored cutover
- 100% line items carry Tracking Categories
- Overdues visible in CRM dashboards

## FAQs (short)

**How long does a typical integration take?**
Most projects ship in **4–6 weeks**: discovery, prototype, testing, go-live.

**Do you handle GST, Tracking Categories, and multi-entity?**
Yes—GST inc/exc, Tracking (Region/Dept), and multiple Xero orgs with routing rules.

**Will payment status land back in HubSpot automatically?**
Yes—**Sent / Part-Paid / Paid / Overdue** and **Payment Date** write back to Deal properties.

**Can you push HubSpot Quotes into Xero and keep line-item data?**
Yes—draft/authorised invoices with line items, tax, SKUs, and Tracking.

**What happens if something fails mid-sync?**
The ODS keeps state; retries are idempotent; errors are human-readable in HubSpot.

## Mini checklist

- [ ] Decide **inclusive vs exclusive** GST
- [ ] Confirm **Tracking Categories** (Category + options)
- [ ] Create mapping properties (Deal + Line Item)
- [ ] Default **AccountCode** chosen
- [ ] Test a single Deal end-to-end
- [ ] Enable **status write-backs**
- [ ] Document **idempotency** & error handling

---

## Test plan

**Happy path**

- Two line items, **GST 10%**, Tracking on each line → invoice created (Draft/Sent)
- Record partial payment → HubSpot shows **Part-Paid**
- Record full payment → **Paid** + **Payment Date**

**Edge cases**

- Exclusive pricing check (rounding)
- Missing Tracking defaults/validation
- Multi-org routing
- Duplicate trigger (no duplicate invoice)
