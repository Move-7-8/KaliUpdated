            {/* END GOAL */}
            <h2 id="end-goal">The end goal of a HubSpot ↔ Xero Integration</h2>
            <p>
                The idea behind integrating HubSpot and Xero is to avoid re-entry (writing data to multiple platforms
                manually). Manually entering data is not only time consuming but can lead to pretty serious accounting
                errors when data inevitably doesn&apos;t match up.
            </p>
            <br />
            <p>
                <strong>Benefits you can achieve with integration:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    • When a Deal or Quote is created in HubSpot, a Xero invoice is automatically generated and linked
                    back to the Deal
                </li>
                <li>
                    • HubSpot is updated with real-time Xero invoice status changes like Sent, Part-Paid, Paid, Overdue,
                    along with payment dates and amounts
                </li>
                <li>• Apply Tracking Categories and consistent GST treatment on each line item</li>
                <li>
                    • Maintain synchronized Contact &amp; Company records between HubSpot and Xero, including name, ABN,
                    addresses
                </li>
                <li>• Map Products to invoice line items, map account codes and tax assignments per line</li>
                <li>
                    • Support staged/progress invoicing (e.g. 30%/50%/20% splits) with automatic updates of Billed % and
                    Outstanding amounts in HubSpot
                </li>
            </ol>

            {/* YOUR OPTIONS */}
            <h2 id="your-options">Your Options</h2>
            <p>
                There are really three options; the official app, third party apps, and custom integrations. Each has
                its use case and intended user, we’ll let you know when you should be using each.
            </p>

            {/* Decision heatmap (centered) */}
            <div className="mt-6 hidden place-items-center [text-align:initial] md:grid">
                <div className="mx-auto w-full max-w-5xl">
                    <TrafficLightDecisionHeatmap className="mx-auto block w-full" />
                </div>
            </div>

            {/* OFFICIAL APP */}
            <h3 className="mt-8 text-xl font-semibold">The official app:</h3>
            <p className="mt-2">
                <strong>Xero App in HubSpot Marketplace</strong>
                <br />
                <em>Cost: Free</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                You can sync contacts and basic products. You can make a draft invoice from inside HubSpot that appears
                in Xero. However, updates coming back into HubSpot (like invoice status and edits) are limited, and
                line-by-line controls like Tracking Categories and GST are not supported.
            </p>
            <p>
                This solution is free, so if you have a basic use case, low risk data, and are a solopreneur, this is
                probably the right choice for you. For minimal effort, it will at least prevent you from needing to
                manually enter customer data into Xero.
            </p>

            {/* THIRD-PARTY APPS */}
            <h3 className="mt-6 text-xl font-semibold">The &apos;off-the-shelf&apos; third-party apps:</h3>
            <p>
                There are a bunch of third party apps, the most popular three are listed below. They're ~mostly~ similar
                in functionality and range in pricing but I've included the features that might set them apart for your
                use-case.
            </p>

            <p>Each of these can do everything the Xero app can do, plus:</p>

            <div className="space-y-6">

                    <h4 className="text-lg font-semibold">Invoice Stack</h4>

                    <ul className="list-inside list-disc space-y-1">
                        <li>HubSpot workflow actions to create Xero invoices directly from deals.</li>

                        <li>Invoice links and status visible on the deal timeline/record.</li>
                    </ul>

                        <li>Straightforward (non-custom)field mapping between HubSpot and Xero.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                {/* Cloudify */}

                These apps are best for small teams with a bit of budget and relatively simple But once you have the
                following needs, you may find yourself carrying technical debt or hitting hard limits:
            </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                <li>Deposits, split invoices, or progress billing (e.g., 30/50/20, milestones, retainers)</li>
                <li>Line-level AccountCode, TaxType, and Tracking Category rules</li>
                <li>Multi-step approvals or segregation of duties</li>
                <li>Multi-currency pricing, invoicing, or FX reconciliation</li>
                <li>Reliability at scale (idempotency, retries, duplicate prevention)</li>
                <li>Accurate write-backs of invoice statuses and payments into HubSpot</li>
                <li>Multi-entity setups or consolidated reporting/audit trail requirements</li>
            </ul>

            <hr className="my-6" />

            {/* CUSTOM INTEGRATION */}
            <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">Custom integration:</h3>
            <p className="mt-2">
                This is best for teams with complexity, risk, or volume (e.g., deposits/progress billing,
                multi-entity/currency, strict finance/audit requirements, or high-volume pipelines) that need
                deterministic line rules, deep write-backs, and full control over reliability, security, and UX.

            {/* <h4 className="mt-4 font-semibold">Cost:</h4> */}

                If you’re a developer with a strong knowledge of databases, and time on your hands, this should outline
                a scalable system that you can try to build yourself.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you're not a developer, or just need it done right. Feel free to get in touch and we can build it for
                a monthly subscription fee that handles the build, maintenance and optimising of your flow. Exact
                figures depend on your specific requirements and volume of data.
            </p>
            <p>
                Either way, the following should make sense to a non-technical reader. It may introduce you to a concept
                that I think is a best practice for any modern business that isn't utilising it's data to its full
                potential.
            </p>

            <h4 className="mt-4 font-semibold">Benefits:</h4>
            <p>In addition to now being able to achieve the shortcomings we just listed: </p>
            <ul className="list-disc pl-6">
                <li>Deposits, split invoices, or progress billing (e.g., 30/50/20, milestones, retainers)</li>
                <li>Line-level AccountCode, TaxType, and Tracking Category rules</li>
                <li>Multi-step approvals or segregation of duties</li>
                <li>Multi-currency pricing, invoicing, or FX reconciliation</li>
                <li>Reliability at scale (idempotency, retries, duplicate prevention)</li>
                <li>Accurate write-backs of invoice statuses and payments into HubSpot</li>
                <li>Multi-entity setups or consolidated reporting/audit trail requirements</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                The major benefit of this approach is not specific to the Hubspot ↔ Xero integration, but is rather the
                underlying concept.
            </p>
            <p>
                {" "}
                <p className="mt-3">
                    Rather than embedding logic “in between” platforms, like the off-the-shelf apps do, best practice is
                    moving it into a controlled database owned by your company. This provides you with a single source
                    of truth with enforceable rules and the ability to extend it to other platforms.
                </p>
            </p>
            <p>
                So you're not just limited to Hubspot ↔ Xero, you can eventually integrate all of your platforms, and
                sources of data into one place. Once it's all in one place, you can build analysis on top of it.

            {/* ODS CONCEPT */}
            <h2>How to build a custom integration</h2>
            <h3>ODS (Operational Data Store)</h3>
            <p className="mt-3">
                The main concept to learn is that of an ODS. A lightweight, company-owned database that sits between
                HubSpot and Xero, and whatever other platforms you want to connect to. We can use it to centralise
                rules, data names, and ensure that information happens in a queue, instead of all at once. Think of it
                as a database that is designed to organise and clean data so we can share it around the business.
            </p>
            <p>
                The cool thing about modern ODSs is that we can spin them up in a data warehouse (a different kind of
                database used to gather all of your companies data for analysis) like Snowflake. This means you not only
                get a means of moving data around your business but it's easy to then start / improve upon your data
                warehouse for better analysis.
            </p>

            <p className="mt-3">
                This is what you want to avoid if you're building a solution for scale, it'll result in some heavy
                limitations as you grow. However, if you're just a small business, and don't want to integrate other
                apps, this is a good fit for now.

            <p className="mt-3">
                This is what the ODS solution can be conceptualised as. The rules, data names, and functionality all
                sits in one place owned by your company. So much cleaner than having to manage the logic on each new
                platform, and generally worth the hassle to build if you're looking to scale. A small headache now will
                save you a lot of headaches later.

                be able to control your data across your entire business. Information will get to where it needs to go,
